To Do
Task: Vagrant
First, you need to create and init a Vagrant project. 
It should be an ubuntu based project. Configure the Vagrant file to spin up a single virtual machine with a public network and install nginx via provisioning. 
Nginx should be running on port 82 (replace port via 'sed' in provisioning). As a result, you should open the nginx page in your host browser and see the "Welcome to nginx" page. 
(Or you can create your own "welcome page" if you'd like :) )
