PART 1: Develop a REST API
Develop a REST API for student management in Python using the Flask library named [app.py}(https://github.com/Visemir/danit-labs/blob/main/homework10/app.py), with data persistence in a students.csv file. 
The API should support GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests. Each student should have fields for id, first name, last name, and age.
