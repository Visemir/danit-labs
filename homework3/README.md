Add the created user to the sudo group (so that they can run commands as an
administrator).

Create a script in the /home/bob/ directory that, when executed, will change the 
hostname to "ubuntu22". The script's execution attributes should be set exclusively for the user "bob".

Run the script. Reboot the system. Log into the system as the "bob"
user.
